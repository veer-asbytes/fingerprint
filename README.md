# Video Similarity Checker

This project provides a tool to check the similarity between two video files using video fingerprinting techniques. The similarity is determined by comparing the extracted frame data from each video.

## Running Tests

To test the similarity between two videos, use the following command:

```bash
cargo test -- --nocapture test_ascii_text_somewhat_similar

```
